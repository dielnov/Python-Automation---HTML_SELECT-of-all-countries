Hello there, I am Dielnov

I had this SELECT for all countries,
got it from https://www.technicalkeeda.com/html-tutorials/all-countries-drop-down-list-in-html
and have the exract options in fix.html included in this repo


However, I wanted the select to show a default value based on the value in my
website's database (I was using django python web framework)
Seeing as how long the list of options is i used Beautiful Soup 
And Python string manipulation to automate the process of adding the
IF, SELECTED, etc to each option for both fields(passportIssuerCountry and countryOf Residence)

Turns Out It Turned Out Pretty Well,
